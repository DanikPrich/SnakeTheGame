# Snake the game

The project is a Vue-based web application. I developed the project on my own. The project is a snake game designed for mobile devices. The game can be controlled using the arrow buttons on the screen of a mobile phone or with the keyboard on a computer. The game includes the following features: game speed settings, counting of the apples collected by the snake, game start, and game restart.
